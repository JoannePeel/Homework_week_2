# Stock-Analysis-with-Excel-VBA

* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

* You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.
* Your result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).
* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
* This can be applied to any of the difficulties.

To submit please upload the following to Github:

* A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.
* VBA Scripts as separate files.
